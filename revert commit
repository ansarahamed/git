When you want to revert a commit

git revert <commit-id>
#This would generate a commit id for every commit you are reverting


However the other option is to use --no-commit

git revert --no-commit <Older commit id> ...... (separated by spaces)

This applies the change in the local
and the user has to do
i) stage the files
ii) commit it.
